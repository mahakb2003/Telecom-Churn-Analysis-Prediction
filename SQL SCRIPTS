-- STEP 1: CREATE DATABASE
-- Creating a dedicated database for churn analysis
-- ===============================================

CREATE DATABASE db_Churn


-- ===============================================
-- STEP 2: IMPORT RAW DATA INTO STAGING TABLE
-- Use SQL Server Import Wizard:
-- Task > Import > Flat File > Browse .csv
-- Set 'Customer_ID' as Primary Key
-- Change any 'BIT' datatype to VARCHAR(50) for smooth import
-- ===============================================


-- ===============================================
-- STEP 3: DATA PROFILING – CHECK DISTINCT VALUES
-- Useful for identifying unique categories and inconsistencies
-- ===============================================
